# Gallucci-SimpleComp
I made this project my senior year of high school. It's relatively old at this point and has a few questionable design/code choices but it's worth preserving, plus it's an interesting concept.

This project came about as a response to a computer literacy class. This class had a unit called "simple computer", where on paper was a basic computer, with memory, instructions, and registers. However, the simple computer system was stuck on paper with no digital version. So, I decided to step in and create a software version of this "simple computer".
