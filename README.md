# Gallucci-SimpleComp
I made this project my senior year of high school. It's relatively old at this point and has a few questionable design/code choices but it's worth preserving, plus it's an interesting concept.

This project came about as a response to a computer literacy class. This class had a unit called "simple computer", where on paper was a basic computer, with memory, instructions, and registers. However, the simple computer system was stuck on paper with no digital version. So, I decided to step in and create a software version of this "simple computer".

Development time overall was about 4 months from conception to completion. I wrote it in C++ but basically ignored classes and anything C++ offered, so it's basically in C. Part of why I probably used C++ is because I wanted to add strings to the saving but couldn't quite get it running. I used the raylib graphics library as well.

The folder contains both a Mac and Windows executable, but can also be compiled on your own if you so wish to either port to another platform (i.e. Linux) or you want to make source code revisions. The latter comes highly recommended since I was 17 when I did it, and because of that, is full of spaghetti and odd quirks.
